# Com3d2-classifier
This model was trained with about 1k images, roughly 15% of which are screenshots from various artists in Com3d2. It was trained on a resnet34 model. 
I've created 2 notebooks, 1 for training and 1 for using the model to do inference after loading it.
Model had about 98% accuracy on the validation set.

## Finding training images
You can find a lot of these in uh... the ... uh... panda site :P. If you're looking for this you should already know.
